/**

 *
 * @brief GLUE is an adapter for a DLL of a protocol stack
 *
 * A protocol stack normally consists of various layers (like TCP, IP,
 * DLL). These layers offer different services which allows other layers to
 * communicate with them. The services are special for each layer. GLUE provides
 * a set of adapter Functional Units that provide services for data link layers
 * to speak with other layers (various PHY layers and IP). These adapater
 * Functional Units are part of a Functional Unit Network which is configured at
 * run-time, thus providing a maximum of flexibility.
